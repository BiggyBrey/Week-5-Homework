# CLI Command 5

## git commit -m "[your message]"

### In command 4 we staged our file by using our 'git add .' command. Now we are going to commit the staged file by entering: ```  git commit -m "my message is whatever I did last" ```. It is important to add the '-m' after the commit to enter your message because it saves you time, where if you didn't do that, your terminal will give you a prompt to enter your message using the old text editor in terminal which can be confusing to new learners.
