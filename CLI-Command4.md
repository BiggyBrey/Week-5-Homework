# CLI Command 4

## The fourth CLI command is 'add .'

### The 'add .' command stages all of the documents and changes that have been made.

#### You may be asking, "what is staging", and that is a good question. 
    You can think this command like a director calling all the documents to the stage to be seen. This is done by our 'add .' command.
